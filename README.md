# Usage

First time :

set the alias you want in the constant in the script

then

```
ruby current_directory.rb
```

then you just have to

```
cd my_current_project_im_working_on
thealiasyouchoosed
```

Then when you open a new term session, you'll stay in this directory

Please don't hesitate to improve it :)

Much love
